# fractures-classification
This project performs binary classification of X-ray images to distinguish between simple and comminuted fractures. It compares two approaches: a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained from scratch and a transfer learning model using EfficientNetB2, aiming to evaluate their effectiveness in medical image analysis.
